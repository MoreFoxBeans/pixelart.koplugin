# pixelart.koplugin

A WIP pixel art editor plugin for KOReader! I've only tested this on my personal reader so it please create an issue if something doesn't work.

## How to install

Download the source code of the [latest release](https://github.com/MoreFoxBeans/pixelart.koplugin/releases), then extract that to get a folder named "pixelart.koplugin". Move that folder into the KOReader plugins directory, (it varies per device but for Kobo readers it's "~/.adds/koreader/plugins"). Restart KOReader and you're done!

## Where do I find it?

It should be located in the "More tools" section of the plugins section of the KOReader menu. If you can't find it, make sure you have restarted KOReader before creating an issue.
